# Game Creation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your game implementation meets all requirements for the Game Interface showcase.

## Planning Phase
- [ ] Read and understand the game prompt thoroughly
- [ ] Identify core game mechanics and requirements
- [ ] Plan the game structure (classes, functions, data flow)
- [ ] Consider potential challenges and edge cases
- [ ] Sketch the user interface and interaction patterns

## Implementation Phase
- [ ] Create the basic file structure
  - [ ] game.js
  - [ ] metadata.json
  - [ ] assets/ (if needed)
- [ ] Implement core game mechanics
  - [ ] Game state management
  - [ ] Game logic
  - [ ] Win/lose conditions
- [ ] Create the user interface
  - [ ] Game board/canvas
  - [ ] Score/status displays
  - [ ] Controls (buttons, inputs)
- [ ] Implement user interaction
  - [ ] Event listeners
  - [ ] Input validation
  - [ ] Feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Add visual and audio feedback
  - [ ] Animations
  - [ ] Visual effects
  - [ ] Sound effects (optional)
- [ ] Implement game flow
  - [ ] Start game
  - [ ] Game loop
  - [ ] End game
  - [ ] Restart functionality

## Testing Phase
- [ ] Test basic functionality
  - [ ] Game starts correctly
